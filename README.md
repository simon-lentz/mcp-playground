## Background

### Static Models

At present, the general expectations for interaction with a generative model are high reponse fluency and accuracy. The utility associated with
the ability to prompt on an arbitrary topic and receive relevant information has driven the development of LLMs to the present SOTA. Numerous strategies
exist to improve the accuracy, relevance, etc. of the generated content: retrieval augmented generation, fine-tuning, and chain of thought reasoning represent
a few of recent strategies highlighted in research work and 'production' integration of static models.

By design, a 'static' model lacks the agency needed to execute on the content it generates. Presently, that is the responsibility of the user.
How can we move from a passive static model to something with greater capacity to *do*?

### Dynamic Agents
